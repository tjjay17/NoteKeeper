# NoteKeeper
A MERN stack application made to help take notes. Version 1 is hosted at https://vigorous-wescoff-72a15f.netlify.app/ 

Please note backend is hosted on heroku and as a result will take some time to load as Heroku dynos sleep when inactive. To counter this I will eventually migrate to AWS Elastic BeanStalk.

Currently, the site is undergoing changes to incorporate user authentication and server side rendering using NextJs.
